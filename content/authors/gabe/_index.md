I started my journey into the physical and biological sciences with an interest in osteopathic medicine. In the process of completing a biochemistry and molecular biology degree, I developed a deep interest in both physical and biochemistry. My PhD research focussed on sensory transduction pathways and light sensing mechanisms in bacteria. After which, I spent two years in a wonderful postdoctorate role with an emphasis on active learning. More recently, I worked as a senior scientist for a small startup with an emphasis on DNA and RNA synthesis. My current passion and professional interests include everything :raised_hands: **R** :raised_hands:!
