I started my journey into the physical and biological sciences with an interest in osteopathic medicine. In the process of completing a biochemistry and molecular biology degree, I developed a deep interest in both physical chemistry and biochemistry. My curiosity resulted in a PhD focussed on sensory transduction pathways and light sensing mechanisms in bacteria. After which, I spent two years in a teaching postdoctorate role that implemented innovative teaching practices in chemistry and biology. More recently (2018-2020), I worked as a senior scientist for a small startup with an emphasis on DNA and RNA synthesis. 

My current passion and professional pursuit includes **computational biology** and **data science**.
