##### The [COVID Case Tracker App](https://biolight-informatics.shinyapps.io/covid-app/) allows one to visualize the number of cases and deaths by day on a State level. California, Hawaii and Florida are selected by defualt but you can add or remove States using the selector box in the sidebar. The accompanying maps use color to show the total cases and total deaths per million people by State. Detailed information can be viewed by scrolling over the State of interest. 

##### The data is from [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and is updated daily. You can explore the app here in this post or open it in a new window by going to the link above. It's hosted on Shinyapps.io and my code is available on [Git<i class="fab fa-github"  style="color: #RRGGBB,"></i>hub](https://github.com/gmednick/covid-shiny-app).
