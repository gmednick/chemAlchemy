<h4>This app uses data from NOAAâ€™s wave model (WWIII) and buoy data near Santa Cruz (buoyid = 46042) to report on the live surf and wind conditions. You can open the app with this <a href="https://biolight-informatics.shinyapps.io/surf_reporter/">link</a> or explore it below. The data is loaded into R using the <code>rnoaa</code> and <code>rNOMADS</code> packages. (The WWIII model map is currently broken so I removed it. I will try and get it back up and working again soon!)</h4>

<h4>In future versions of this app, I plan to animate the wave model data. I would also like to add features that give the user more control (i.e., be able to select regions and buoys) and possibly create a predictive long-range model. This app is currently limited by the slow nature of data retrieval from NOAA. To prevent it from timing out before loading, I have a separate script for extracting the data, filtering it down, then saving the results to file. I am using a scheduling manager (Cron) to automate this process but, unfortunately, this only updates the files on my computer so I have to redeploy the app in order to display the most recent data (this defeats the purpose of live data). I am currently in the process of figuring out how to automate this process using google sheets and the googlesheets4 package in R. My code is available on <a href="https://github.com/gmednick/surf-watch/blob/master/app.R">Git<i class="fab fa-github"  style="color: #FFCC00"></i>hub</a>.</h4>
