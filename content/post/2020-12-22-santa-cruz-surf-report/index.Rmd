#### This post uses data from NOAA's wave model and buoy data near Santa Cruz (buoyid = 46042) to report on the surf and wind conditions. You can click this [link](https://biolight-informatics.shinyapps.io/surf_reporter/) or explore the app embedded below. The data is accessed in R with the packages `rnoaa` and `rNOMADS`. The wave model data is in a binary format and somewhat challenging to work with. 

#### In the near future, I plan to make the app more interactive, animate the wave model data and provide value boxes to see the most recent conditions. The code for the app is available on [Git<i class="fab fa-github"  style="color: #32cd32"></i>hub](https://github.com/gmednick/surf-watch/blob/master/app.R).

#### Please note the app takes a minute to load.
