#### This post uses data from NOAA's wave model (WWIII) and buoy data near Santa Cruz (buoyid = 46042) to report on the surf and wind conditions. You can click this [link](https://biolight-informatics.shinyapps.io/surf_reporter/) or explore the app embedded below. The data is accessed in R with the packages `rnoaa` and `rNOMADS`.  

#### In future versions of the app, I plan to animate the wave model data and provide value boxes to see the most recent conditions. I would also like to add features that give the user more ability to explore. My code is available on [Git<i class="fab fa-github"  style="color: #FFCC00"></i>hub](https://github.com/gmednick/surf-watch/blob/master/app.R).

#### Please note the app takes a minute to load.
