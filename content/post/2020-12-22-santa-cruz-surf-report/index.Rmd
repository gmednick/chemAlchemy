#### As a life-long surfer, building this simple app brought me great joy! The app uses data from NOAA's wave model (WWIII) and buoy data near Santa Cruz (buoyid = 46042) to report on the surf and wind conditions. You can click this [link](https://biolight-informatics.shinyapps.io/surf_reporter/) or explore the app embedded below. The data is loaded into R using the `rnoaa` and `rNOMADS` packages.  

#### In future versions of this app, I plan to animate the wave model data. I would also like to add features that give the user more control (i.e., be able to select regions and buoys). This app is currently limited by the slow nature of data retrieval from NOAA. To prevent it from timing out before loading, I have a separate script for extracting the data, filtering it down, then saving the results to file. I am using a scheduling manager (Cron) to automate this process and keep the app up to date. Unfortunately, this only updates the files on my computer so I have to redeploy the app in order to display the most recent data. I am currently in the process of figuring out how to use google sheets in R so the app can stay update conditions without manual intervention. My code is available on [Git<i class="fab fa-github"  style="color: #FFCC00"></i>hub](https://github.com/gmednick/surf-watch/blob/master/app.R).

#### Please note the app takes a minute to load.
