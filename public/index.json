In my experiences as a researcher and now a data scientist at RStudio, I’ve had the pleasure to work on many literate projects, and I’ve felt the pain of working on illiterate ones too.

We know that practical skills matter, like being able to wrangle, explore, analyze, and visualize data (preferably using code), but what is easy to overlook is teaching students how to communicate about data science with other people. Being able to communicate about data, code, and insights gained are important skills we can strengthen in the classroom to make a real impact on students. I will talk about three ways to help strengthen data science communication skills that matter: self-reflection, iteration, and broadcasting. Self-reflection involves asking students to reflect on concepts and/or code that they struggled with to increase engagement with materials and independent problem-solving. Iteration involves revisiting old concepts/code, identifying areas for improvement, and making them better, either independently or in collaboration with peers or other experts/advanced users. Broadcasting involves practice (practice, practice, practice) “wrapping up” code with words into coherent narratives about what a data analysis or visualization means.\n","date":1564434001,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560922981,"objectID":"3fe48e633a761d0dd08d01a2df86f7cc","permalink":"/talk/2019-jsm-talk-ds/","publishdate":"2019-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-jsm-talk-ds/","section":"talk","summary":"Practical

This study attempts to identify and characterize cognitive subtypes within the ASD population using a random forest (RF) machine learning classification model. We trained our model on measures from seven tasks that reflect multiple levels of information processing. 47 ASD diagnosed and 58 typically developing (TD) children between the ages of 9 and 13 participated in this study. Our RF model was 72.7% accurate, with 80.7% specificity and 63.1% sensitivity. Using the RF model, we measured the proximity of each subject to every other subject, generating a distance matrix between participants. This matrix was then used in a community detection algorithm to identify subgroups within the ASD and TD groups, revealing 3 ASD and 4 TD putative subgroups with unique behavioral profiles. We then examined differences in functional brain systems between diagnostic groups and putative subgroups using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rsfcMRI).

The blogdown package is also suitable for technical writing with elements such as citations, footnotes, and LaTeX math. This makes blogdown an ideal platform for any website designed to communicate information about data science, data analysis, data visualization, or R programming. Note that blogdown is not just for blogging or sites about R; it can also be used to create general-purpose websites.

Speech disfluencies may serve pragmatic functions such as cueing speaking problems. Previous studies have found that speakers with ASD differ from typically developing (TD) speakers in the types and patterns of disfluencies they produce, but fail to provide sufficiently detailed characterizations of the methods used to categorize and quantify disfluency, making cross-study comparison difficult. In this study we propose a simple schema for classifying major disfluency types, and use this schema in an exploratory analysis of differences in disfluency rates and patterns among children with ASD compared to TD and language impaired (SLI) groups. 115 children ages 4–8 participated in the study (ASD = 51; SLI = 20; TD = 44), completing a battery of experimental tasks and assessments. Measures of morphological and syntactic complexity, as well as word and disfluency counts, were derived from transcripts of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). High inter-annotator agreement was obtained with the use of the proposed schema. Analyses showed ASD children produced a higher ratio of content to filler disfluencies than TD children. Relative frequencies of repetitions, revisions, and false starts did not differ significantly between groups. TD children also produced more cued disfluencies than ASD children.","tags":null,"title":"Quantitative Analysis of Disfluency in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder or Language Impairment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alison","Julianne Myers"],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1466726400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1466726400,"objectID":"59403374a7f27f5117bf0f8cd8b03611","permalink":"/talk/2016-ohsu-dataviz/","publishdate":"2016-06-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-ohsu-dataviz/","section":"talk","summary":"A workshop on visualizing your data with ggplot2 and matplotlib","tags":["workshop","dataviz","ggplot2"],"title":"Code Your Graph Workshop","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["workshop"],"content":"This two-day workshop is designed for those who want to take their R Markdown skills to the next level. We’ll talk about many low-level details in the rmarkdown package and the whole R Markdown ecosystem. The two goals of this workshop are: 1) learn how to fully customize R Markdown output (HTML, LaTeX/PDF, Word, and PowerPoint); and 2) learn more about existing R Markdown extensions in the ecosystem, such as flexdashboard, bookdown, blogdown, pkgdown, xaringan, rticles, and learnr. We will also talk about how to use or develop new language engines (languages that are not R), how to develop HTML widgets, and integrate Shiny with R Markdown.\nSee the workshop website for more, and links to individual slides below.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"2a508153b3ae9e46d1a6cb1beb8234e0","permalink":"/project/advanced-r-markdown/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/advanced-r-markdown/","section":"project","summary":"A two-day workshop for those who want to take their R Markdown skills to the next level","tags":["workshop","R","blogdown","xaringan","bookdown","flexdashboard","rmarkdown"],"title":"Advanced R Markdown","type":"project"}]
