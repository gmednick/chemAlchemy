There are five related datasets in total but we will only look at key_crop_yields in this exploration. The data contains crop yield by country and year.

For starters, we can see from the skimr summary that there are a bunch of NAs that we need to decide what to do with. We can also standarize our feature names with the janitor package. We should also consider whether our data is in a tidy format where each column is a feature and each row a sample since this is fundamental necessity for working with data in the tidyverse and tidymodels frameworks. In our data example, the various crops on samples, that can be categorized as the feature crops. The function pivot_longer is fantastic function from the tidyr package that allows us to reshape our data and preparing it for This will benefit our downstream analysis, including EDA (exploratory data analysis) and modeling (machine learning).\ncrop_yields %\u0026gt;% count(Year) ## # A tibble: 58 x 2 ## Year n ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 1961 209 ## 2 1962 209 ## 3 1963 209 ## 4 1964 209 ## 5 1965 209 ## 6 1966 211 ## 7 1967 211 ## 8 1968 213 ## 9 1969 213 ## 10 1970 213 ## # … with 48 more rows # Use janitor package to clean column names and pivot_longer from tidyr to tidy the data. crop_yield_tidy \u0026lt;- crop_yields %\u0026gt;% janitor::clean_names() %\u0026gt;% rename_all(str_remove, \u0026quot;_tonnes.*\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% rename(country = entity) %\u0026gt;% pivot_longer(wheat:bananas, names_to = \u0026#39;crop\u0026#39;, values_to = \u0026#39;yield_hectare\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% drop_na(yield_hectare) kable(head(crop_yield_tidy, n = 10))   country code year crop yield_hectare    Afghanistan AFG 1961 wheat 1.0220  Afghanistan AFG 1961 rice 1.5190  Afghanistan AFG 1961 maize 1.4000  Afghanistan AFG 1961 potatoes 8.6667  Afghanistan AFG 1961 barley 1.0800  Afghanistan AFG 1962 wheat 0.9735  Afghanistan AFG 1962 rice 1.5190  Afghanistan AFG 1962 maize 1.4000  Afghanistan AFG 1962 potatoes 7.6667  Afghanistan AFG 1962 barley 1.0800     Visual analysis Now that we have the data in tidy format, let’s see what we can learn from it. We want to look at crop production by country but there are too many countries to look at all of them at once. slice_sample() can be used to randomly select a subset of the total countries. A seed can be set if you want slice_sample to return the same 8 countries each time. We will use the results to visualize a subset of the countries with the idea that this will help us understand our data better and generate questions that can guide our predictive modeling.\n# Randomly select 4 country codes # set.seed(1014) country_random \u0026lt;- crop_yield_tidy %\u0026gt;% select(country) %\u0026gt;% distinct() %\u0026gt;% slice_sample(n = 9) %\u0026gt;% pull() # another option would be to set the code equal to a set selection of countries: E.g., countries \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#39;GUM\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;IND\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;YEM\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;NAM\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;URY\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;USA\u0026#39;) # Plot crop yield per hectare. library(tidytext) column_plot \u0026lt;- crop_yield_tidy %\u0026gt;% filter(year \u0026gt;= 2000, country == country_random) %\u0026gt;% mutate(crop = reorder_within(crop, yield_hectare, country)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(yield_hectare, crop, fill = crop)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~country, scales = \u0026#39;free\u0026#39;) + theme(legend.position = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;) + scale_y_reordered() + labs( title = \u0026#39;Crop Yield\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Crop\u0026#39;, x = \u0026#39;yield per hectare\u0026#39; ) column_plot # Plot crop yield per hectare per year. line_plot \u0026lt;- crop_yield_tidy %\u0026gt;% filter(year \u0026gt;= 2000, country == country_random) %\u0026gt;% mutate(crop = fct_reorder(crop, yield_hectare)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(year, yield_hectare, color = crop)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~country, scales = \u0026#39;free_y\u0026#39;) + labs( y = \u0026#39;yield per hectare\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;Crop Yield\u0026#39; ) line_plot # Plot crop yield per hectare per year. box_plot \u0026lt;- crop_yield_tidy %\u0026gt;% filter(year \u0026gt;= 2000, country == country_random) %\u0026gt;% mutate(crop = fct_reorder(crop, yield_hectare)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(yield_hectare, crop, color = crop)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(legend.position = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;) + facet_wrap(~country, scales = \u0026#39;free\u0026#39;) + labs( x = \u0026#39;Yield\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;Crop Yield\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; ) box_plot  ","date":1599091200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599196344,"objectID":"7ab900960e472a8bde7aa822b075d5b9","permalink":"/post/hello-tidyverse/","publishdate":"2020-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hello-tidyverse/","section":"post","summary":"Data wrangling and visualization: insights into data analysis with the tidyverse","tags":[],"title":"Hello Tidyverse and Tidymodels","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["workshop"],"content":"  This four-hour workshop will provide a gentle introduction to machine learning with R using the modern suite of predictive modeling packages called tidymodels.

We know that practical skills matter, like being able to wrangle, explore, analyze, and visualize data (preferably using code), but what is easy to overlook is teaching students how to communicate about data science with other people. Being able to communicate about data, code, and insights gained are important skills we can strengthen in the classroom to make a real impact on students. I will talk about three ways to help strengthen data science communication skills that matter: self-reflection, iteration, and broadcasting. Self-reflection involves asking students to reflect on concepts and/or code that they struggled with to increase engagement with materials and independent problem-solving.

This study attempts to identify and characterize cognitive subtypes within the ASD population using a random forest (RF) machine learning classification model. We trained our model on measures from seven tasks that reflect multiple levels of information processing. 47 ASD diagnosed and 58 typically developing (TD) children between the ages of 9 and 13 participated in this study. Our RF model was 72.7% accurate, with 80.7% specificity and 63.1% sensitivity. Using the RF model, we measured the proximity of each subject to every other subject, generating a distance matrix between participants. This matrix was then used in a community detection algorithm to identify subgroups within the ASD and TD groups, revealing 3 ASD and 4 TD putative subgroups with unique behavioral profiles. We then examined differences in functional brain systems between diagnostic groups and putative subgroups using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rsfcMRI).

The blogdown package is also suitable for technical writing with elements such as citations, footnotes, and LaTeX math. This makes blogdown an ideal platform for any website designed to communicate information about data science, data analysis, data visualization, or R programming. Note that blogdown is not just for blogging or sites about R; it can also be used to create general-purpose websites. By default, blogdown uses Hugo, a popular open-source static website generator, which provides a fast and flexible way to build your site content to be shared online.

Speech disfluencies may serve pragmatic functions such as cueing speaking problems. Previous studies have found that speakers with ASD differ from typically developing (TD) speakers in the types and patterns of disfluencies they produce, but fail to provide sufficiently detailed characterizations of the methods used to categorize and quantify disfluency, making cross-study comparison difficult. In this study we propose a simple schema for classifying major disfluency types, and use this schema in an exploratory analysis of differences in disfluency rates and patterns among children with ASD compared to TD and language impaired (SLI) groups. 115 children ages 4–8 participated in the study (ASD = 51; SLI = 20; TD = 44), completing a battery of experimental tasks and assessments. Measures of morphological and syntactic complexity, as well as word and disfluency counts, were derived from transcripts of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). High inter-annotator agreement was obtained with the use of the proposed schema. Analyses showed ASD children produced a higher ratio of content to filler disfluencies than TD children. Relative frequencies of repetitions, revisions, and false starts did not differ significantly between groups. TD children also produced more cued disfluencies than ASD children.","tags":null,"title":"Quantitative Analysis of Disfluency in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder or Language Impairment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alison","Julianne Myers"],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1466726400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1466726400,"objectID":"59403374a7f27f5117bf0f8cd8b03611","permalink":"/talk/2016-ohsu-dataviz/","publishdate":"2016-06-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-ohsu-dataviz/","section":"talk","summary":"A workshop on visualizing your data with ggplot2 and matplotlib","tags":["workshop","dataviz","ggplot2"],"title":"Code Your Graph Workshop","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["workshop"],"content":"This two-day workshop is designed for those who want to take their R Markdown skills to the next level.
